# Cyclistic_Data_Analysis_R

This repository is done for the Capstone Project given in Google Data Analytics 2023. The objective is to provide conclusion using analysis on the given scenario in order to convert casuals into members.

### Scenario

You are a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago.

Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.
